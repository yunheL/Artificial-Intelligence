/*
 * This class is suppose to work as:
 * Given a String that describes a Unix-like file
 * system. For example:
 * root
 * 	dir1
 * 		file1.txt
 * 		dir11
 *  dir2
 *  	pic1.jpg
 *  
 * Find and return length (counting chars) the full
 * path to a picture file.
 * For example:
 * root/dir1/pic1.jpg
 * Then this class should return 18
 * 
 * Note that your algorithm should have complexity:
 * Worst-space O(N)
 * Worst-time O(N)
